I used class replays, W3school, and stackoverflow to help me with the task.
Created html-work branch
    Linked bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery, css, and script.js.
    Made 3 column left side container for search and search history.
    Set  the search container to dynamically show past cities.
    Made 9 column container for current and 5 day forecast.
    Inserted current day weather, five day forecast header, and forecast cards.
