I used class replays, W3school, and stackoverflow to help me with the task.

Created html-work branch

    Linked bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery, css, and script.js.
    Made 3 column left side container for search and search history.
    Set  the search container to dynamically show past cities.
    Made 9 column container for current and 5 day forecast.
    Inserted current day weather, five day forecast header, and forecast cards.

Created css-work branch

    Made global font family. 
    Cented the body so the search for the city is on the left. 
    Added color to the different container and width to the card body. 
    Added padding so everything is not up against the edge of the page.

Created java-work branch
